                                        - The dataset does not contain any missing values suggesting that it is well maintained and updated.
                                        - There are {self.original.check_duplicates()} indicating some redundant entries.
                                        - A significant number of anomalies ({self.original.count_outliers_iqr()}) exist in the dataset. Their existance could be credited to intentional (event-driven) causes like mass purchases.

                                        ### Insights
                                        1. **Strong Revenue Generation**

                                        - *Total Sale* : The company has made {total_sale} sales in the past {self.filtered_data['Year'].nunique()} years. This implies a healthy business size. Business focuses on high-value sales or large-order volumes.
                                        - *Average Sale* : On average, each customer contributes {average_sale} in sales, which is high, indicating a likely Business to Business or high-ticket Business to Customer business.

                                        2. **Average Unit Economics**

                                        - *Total Quantity Sold* : {total_quantity} units sold in the {self.filtered_data['Year'].nunique()} years, which is a significant amount. 
                                        - *Average Price per Unit* : On an average, the price of products purchased by the customers is {average_price} (mid-hundreds range) suggesting premium-priced pharmaceutical products.

                                        3. **Customer Behavior**
                                        - *Total Customers* : {total_customer} customers buy products fromt he company in the {self.filtered_data['Year'].nunique()} years, where the total number of times purchases have been made is around {self.preprocess.data_size()[0]}. This suggests repeated purchase from customers.
                                        - *Average Quantity sold per Customer* : {int(sum(self.filtered_data['Quantity']))/int(self.filtered_data['Customer Name'].nunique()):.2f} quantity of items are sold to each customer. This means customers are not just buying one or two units; theyâ€™re making bulk purchases (avg ~114 units), again suggesting enterprise-scale or wholesale transactions.

                                        4. **Sales Concentration**

                                        - With a high Average Sale per Customer ({average_sale}), there may be a concentration risk if a few customers make up a large portion of revenue.

                                    ### Insights on Number of Unique Values in each Column:
                                    The following count of unique values in each data feature suggests:
                                    - **Distributor**: There are {self.preprocess.check_unique_values().iloc[0,1]} unique values in the dataset. The values are a string of characters suggesting it could be a categorical data.
                                    - **Customer Name, Cities**: 'Customer Name' and 'Cities' features contain {self.preprocess.check_unique_values().iloc[1,1]} and {self.preprocess.check_unique_values().iloc[2,1]} unique values in the dataset, respectively. Despite the data not being numerical, their high number of unique values make it impossible to categorize them as categorical features. Therefore it is a high-cardinality categorical feature. The count of these features shall be useful to interpret some insights from the data.
                                    - **Country**: There are only {self.preprocess.check_unique_values().iloc[3,1]} unique values in this feature. Since the values are strings of characters it will be treated as categorical feature.
                                    - **Latitude, Longitude**: 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' features have {self.preprocess.check_unique_values().iloc[4,1]} and {self.preprocess.check_unique_values().iloc[5,1]} unique continuous numerical values respectively. They are helpful in conducting geospatial analysis of how the data is distributed across the countries.
                                    - **Channel, Sub-channel**: 'Channel' contains {self.preprocess.check_unique_values().iloc[6,1]} unqiue categorical (string) values and 'Sub-channel' contains {self.preprocess.check_unique_values().iloc[7,1]} unique features, also categorical.
                                    - **Product Name**: 'Product Name' also has high-cardinality with unique values counting to {self.preprocess.check_unique_values().iloc[8,1]}. Due to this property of the feature, it is suitable for the count of products within the data.
                                    - **Product Class**: With a total number of {self.preprocess.check_unique_values().iloc[9,1]} unique values, this feature helps understand the type of pharmaceutical products sold by the company and by how much.
                                    - **Quantity**: 'Quantity' is a numerical feature providing insights on how much each product has been sold. The total number of unique values within this feature is {self.preprocess.check_unique_values().iloc[10,1]}. Compared to the size of the dataset, the number of unique values are quite less suggesting similar buying pattern.
                                    - **Price, Sales**: 'Price' has a unique count of {self.preprocess.check_unique_values().iloc[11,1]}. This suggests some products are sold in the same price. 'Sales' on the other hand has a unique count of {self.preprocess.check_unique_values().iloc[12,1]} which suggests the total cost of purchase of each item considring how much (Quantity) has been bought.
                                    - **Month, Year, Date**: These three features, each {self.preprocess.check_unique_values().iloc[13,1]}, {self.preprocess.check_unique_values().iloc[14,1]} and {self.preprocess.check_unique_values().iloc[18,1]}, represent the time of purchase. These features are helpful in time series analysis. The unique count of 'Date' suggests full cycle has been completed in all four years, meaning all the months are present in the final year as well.
                                    - **Sales Representative, Sales Manager, Sales Team**: These 3 features (each {self.preprocess.check_unique_values().iloc[15,1]}, {self.preprocess.check_unique_values().iloc[16,1]} and {self.preprocess.check_unique_values().iloc[17,1]}) hold the names of the representatives, managers and teams responsible for sales. Due to the low cardinality, they are suitable for being categorical features.

                                        - The dataset contains {int(self.analyser.data_description().iloc[0,0])} transactions, indicating a robust sample size for reliable business analysis and forecasting models.
                                        - Average transaction quantity is {(self.analyser.data_description().iloc[1,0]):.2f} units with extremely high variability (standard deviation of {(self.analyser.data_description().iloc[2,0]):.2f}), suggesting a mix of small retail orders and large institutional bulk purchases.
                                        - Price points are well-distributed with an average of {(self.analyser.data_description().iloc[1,1]):.2f}, ranging from {int(self.analyser.data_description().iloc[3,1])} to {int(self.analyser.data_description().iloc[7,1])}, indicating diverse product portfolio spanning budget to premium segments.
                                        - Sales values show an enormous range from {(self.analyser.data_description().iloc[3,2]):.2f} to {(self.analyser.data_description().iloc[7,2]/1000000):.2f}M per transaction, with 75% of transactions below {(self.analyser.data_description().iloc[6,2]):.2f}, while top quartile drives significantly higher revenues.
                                        - The median transaction size ({(self.analyser.data_description().iloc[5,2]):.2f}) is much lower than the average ({(self.analyser.data_description().iloc[1,2]):.2f}), indicating most sales are smaller volume while a few large deals heavily impact overall performance.

                                        - **Sales Skewness ({s_for_sale:.2f})**: Extremely right-skewed distribution means the business is heavily dependent on occasional very large sales transactions, creating revenue concentration risk and making cash flow unpredictable.
                                        - **Quantity Skewness ({s_for_quantity:.2f})**: Most orders are small volume, but occasional massive bulk orders significantly impact inventory planning and supply chain management requirements.
                                        - **Price Skewness ({s_for_price:.2f})**: Nearly normal distribution suggests well-balanced pricing strategy across the product portfolio without extreme concentration in high or low-priced items.
                                        - **High Kurtosis Values (Sales: {k_for_sale:.2f}, Quantity: {k_for_quantity:.2f})**: Extreme outliers occur much more frequently than normal distribution would predict, indicating the business experiences unpredictable "black swan" events requiring robust risk management strategies.
                                        - **Price Kurtosis ({k_for_price:.2f})**: More uniform price distribution than normal, suggesting deliberate pricing strategy to avoid extreme price points that might alienate customer segments.

                                        - {res.iloc[2,0]} Channel Dominance: Pharmacy sales significantly outperform {res.iloc[0,0]} channels, with {res.iloc[3,1]} contracts (approximately {res.iloc[3,2]/1000000000:.2f}B) representing the single largest revenue stream, indicating strong public sector relationships.
                                        - {res.iloc[0,1]} vs {res.iloc[1,1]} Hospital Gap: {res.iloc[0,1]} hospital sales exceed {res.iloc[1,1]} hospital sales by roughly {(res.iloc[0,2] - res.iloc[1,2])/1000000:.0f}M, suggesting either preferential {res.iloc[0,1]} contracts, larger order volumes, or more favorable pricing structures in the public sector.
                                        - {res.iloc[2,0]} Channel Balance: {res.iloc[2,1]} and {res.iloc[3,1]} pharmacy segments show relatively equal performance (both around {((res.iloc[3,2] - res.iloc[2,2])/2+res.iloc[2,2])/1000000000:.2f}B), indicating successful dual-channel strategy in the {res.iloc[2,0]} market with no over-dependence on either segment.
                                        - Cross-Channel Revenue Distribution: {res.iloc[0,0]} channels generate approximately {(res.iloc[0,2] + res.iloc[1,2])/1000000000:.2f}B total revenue compared to {res.iloc[2,0]} channels' {(res.iloc[2,2] + res.iloc[3,2])/1000000000:.2f}B, showing the {res.iloc[2,0]} sector as the slightly larger overall market despite individual transaction sizes being smaller.
                                        - Strategic Implications: The balanced performance across four distinct sub-channels ({res.iloc[0,1]} hospital, {res.iloc[1,1]} hospital, {res.iloc[2,1]}al pharmacy, {res.iloc[3,1]} pharmacy) provides strong risk diversification and multiple growth opportunities.
                                        - Market Penetration Opportunities: The relatively close performance between {res.iloc[2,1]}al and {res.iloc[3,1]} pharmacy suggests potential for targeted campaigns to capture greater market share in the slightly underperforming retail segment.
                                        - Revenue Concentration Risk: While diversified across channels, the heavy reliance on {res.iloc[0,1]} hospital contracts creates potential vulnerability to policy changes or budget cuts in public healthcare spending.

                                        - The hospital channel consistently outperformed pharmacy channels across all years, indicating stronger institutional relationships and bulk purchasing patterns.
                                        - A review of December 2020 data indicates a significant decline in the hospital channel's performance, contrasted by a substantial spike in the pharmacy channel. This disparity raises the hypothesis that market factors, such as increased consumer reliance on retail pharmacies and potentially growing competitive pressure in the hospital sector, were at play.

                                            - German cities dominate the top-performing real estate markets, with Polish cities notably absent due to lower average sale prices. For instance, {df.iloc[0,0]} leads with an average sale price of {df.iloc[0,1]/1000:.2f}k and a total of {df.iloc[0,2]/1000:.2f}k units sold, signaling a highly active and premium property market.
                                            - {df.iloc[1,0]} and {df.iloc[2,0]} follow with average sale prices of {df.iloc[1,1]/1000:.2f}k and {df.iloc[2,1]/1000:.2f}k respectively, while still maintaining strong transaction volumes of {df.iloc[1,2]/1000:.2f}k and {df.iloc[2,2]/1000:.2f}k units. This suggests these cities offer a more affordable entry point without sacrificing market activity.
                                            - In contrast, cities like {df.iloc[8,0]} ({df.iloc[8,1]/1000:.2f}k, {df.iloc[8,2]/1000:.2f}kunits sold) and {df.iloc[9,0]} ({df.iloc[9,1]/1000:.2f}k, {df.iloc[9,2]/1000:.2f}k units sold) show lower values on both metrics but still outperform Polish cities, emphasizing how average sale price heavily influences visibility in this dataset.
                                            - Overall, the data reflects a clear trend: higher property values correlate strongly with market prominence, even when transaction volumes are comparable.""")

This suggests the business experienced growth initially, followed by a plateau and mild decline in recent months.
                                        - Seasonality (Recurring Patterns): The seasonal component (green line) shows repeating fluctuations across the months, with revenue consistently rising in some months (peaks above 1.2) and falling in others (dips near 0.8). This indicates strong seasonal effects - likely tied to periodic demand cycles (e.g., holidays, annual events, or industry-specific cycles).

However, since the deviations arenâ€™t extreme most of the time, the majority of variation is well explained by trend and seasonality.

                                        - **Strong Seasonality**: There is a clear and consistent seasonal pattern in sales, with peaks typically occurring in the summer months (around July) and troughs in the winter months (around January). This seasonality is evident throughout the historical sales data and is captured well by the Prophet Forecast.
                                        - **Overall Upward Trend (Pre-2021)**: From January 2017 to early 2021, while fluctuating due to seasonality, the general trend of historical sales shows a gradual increase, indicating growth over this period.
                                        - **Significant Spike and Volatility in Mid-2021**: The graph shows an exceptionally large and sharp peak in sales around July 2021, far exceeding previous historical peaks. This is followed by a steep decline, indicating a period of high volatility and an unusual event or change in the market during that time.
                                        - **Prophet Forecast Accuracy**: The Prophet Forecast generally aligns closely with the Historical Sales data, particularly in capturing the seasonal patterns and overall trends, suggesting a good fit for the model. The forecast also predicts the sharp rise in mid-2021 and the subsequent drop, although the magnitude of the forecast peak is slightly lower than the actual historical sales peak in July 2021.
                                        - **Confidence Interval**: The confidence interval (shaded blue area) provides a range within which future sales are expected to fall with a certain probability. The historical sales mostly remain within this interval, indicating the reliability of the forecast. However, the actual sales peak in July 2021 significantly exceeds the upper bound of the confidence interval, highlighting an unforeseen event or a limitation of the model in predicting extreme outliers.
                                        - **Post-Peak Normalization**: Following the dramatic spike and decline in mid-2021, the forecast suggests a return to a more typical seasonal pattern, albeit at a slightly higher baseline than pre-2021 levels.
